# Holesky Testnet Project

This project interacts with the Holesky Testnet blockchain. It includes functionality for locking tokens using smart contracts, interacting with the blockchain, and handling ERC-20 token transfers.

## Overview

This project allows users to create a lock for ERC-20 tokens, transfer tokens, and interact with smart contracts on the Holesky Testnet. It uses Solidity-based smart contracts to manage locks and token transfers.

## Features

- **Create Locks**: Users can create locks for their tokens, specifying parameters like amount, percentage, start time, and end time.
- **ERC-20 Token Transfer**: Transfer ERC-20 tokens between addresses.
- **Blockchain Interactions**: Interact with the Holesky Testnet for testing and deployment.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js installed on your system.
- A Holesky Testnet account and wallet.
- Web3.js or ethers.js library to interact with the blockchain.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
